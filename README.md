redmine_cantemo_select2
=======================

This is a plugin which changes the dropdown elements of the issue edit
form in redmine into select2 dropdowns for simpler input. This is
primarily built for Cantemo's internal redmine but feel free to use it
freely, as long as you follow the license restrictions.
